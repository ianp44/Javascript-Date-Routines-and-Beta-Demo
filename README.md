These are the key files for my Javascript Dates routines financial payment calendar beta demo.

See source code in key files for copyright detail.

The point in registering this is to copyright the date routines. They convert day month year integer values to and from days from origin year. (Currently set to 1964.) Also convert to and from date text string format dd/mm/yy.

These routines are tested and I think highly reliable.

The routines that aren't are the calculate and set total months. They might be buggy.

If you set the total months to imply a month value such as February, but the day in the month value is, say 30, it will report an error, as February can't have 30 days in it.

It handles leapyears etc. totally correctly.

To demo it download all the files and run them from a folder. Some of the links won't work in isolation, but the page will run correctly etc.
